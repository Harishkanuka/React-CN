# React-CN
- Getting started with React
- React is a JavaScript Library
- Everything in react is a component
- We can inject React into any existing projects too, without affecting the other areas. For if we already have 2 div-s above 
and below the root div, the React will only affect the root div and the others will be displayed as usual.
